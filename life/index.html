        <h2>The Objects Surround Us</h2>
        <p>These are the objects that surround me.<br/>  Still life.<br>  Life stilled.  Those things which I touch every day or maybe they are collected because they are neat or they are momentous from my past.  Talismans to my mind.
        </p>
        <p>There is a great history of painting the objects around oneself;  Itâ€™s a meditation in paint where thought disappears and the focus is on moving paint around and sculpting the texture of the image.  Finding the way light reacts with the surface of both the object being painted and the facsimile in paint.
        </p>
        <p>At some point the object in reality is replaced entirely by the one on canvas and at this point the only thing that matters is the life the painting holds.  Reality melts away and a new object is found.  The paintings are facsimiles in spirit above all else - the being of the object must be transmitted.</p>
        <p>They are my sanity when the other work becomes too hard.</p>
