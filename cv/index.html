<p>On a singular canvas, Kyle Cunningham frames the world as he sees it today, as it was yesterday, and as it could be tomorrow, merging almost cavelike images with the technologies of the future. Each piece is unique and poignant: paying homage to our pre-history while forcing us to examine how far we have come. Still life paintings raise the clout level of the simple, mundane objects whose presence infuses our being, consciously or not.  Dinosaurs with agua-lungs, elephants in space suits, whimsical perhaps, but each has been a part of our history or sits on the arc of the future. In the repetition of the random is found the building blocks of our psyches; each painting is real and resonates with familiarity.  He reminds us that though the day is long we are each but a piece of this being known as existence: complex and sublime. </p>

<p>
Kyle was raised in Montana but now lives with his partner Jeannie Ortiz on the banks of the Rio Grande on the edge of the great Gila Wilderness in Truth or Consequences, NM. Momentarily tethered to the New Mexico sun but nomads at heart, they garden and make things.
