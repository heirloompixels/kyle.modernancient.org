                        <p><i>November 1st, 2018:</i> The last month has been fruitfull for the creation of the Oeuvre. I've done an intiatial pass on my backup hardrives and located a good amount of photos of my past work. I've made several starts on this project and by using this as a base I've pieced together most of the major works I've created.</p>
                        <p>Choosing a directory layout structer has been an enlightening expedition to then end up at the most obvious and basic structure: year - type of art - individual art such as 2018/installations/tomorrow.

                        <i>October 1st, 2018:</i> I'm slowly working my way back into the archives of my work searching out pictures I should have been more diligent about keeping track of. I hope to catalog everything I've made in time but many things have been collected away and I've not located pictures of them.</p>
